    	<h2>Origins</h2><p>
    		The Twisting Haunt was originally envisioned as a final project for a low-level Computer Science class at Winona State University to properly showcase the use of abstraction and interfaces. The Twisting Haunt also heavily utilized polymorphism, recursion, and gracefully showcased the power of an object-oriented programming language. 
    		<br><br>
            The Twisting Haunt has since evolved, involving members from various universities and graduates. The core of the game is still the same - write a text based rpg where the user can traverse instances (and potentially open-world), battle foes, complete quests, and enjoy a compelling and horrifying story.

            <h3>Original Quote From Assignment</h3>
            <p>
            The original idea for this project was originally drawn out in a previous class, Data Structures. 
            This original idea was based off a similar project that Jasonâ€™s father did when he was in college, and these types of games were popular. 
            That game was different then what we are trying to make but was none the less the inspiration for this project. 
            When we started planning in Data Structures, we realized that the project would have been a lot more work than we originally thought, 
            and fell a bit out of scope of the assignment. The project was eventually scrapped in favor of an individual system from the original project, 
            which we were able fully flesh out and complete. This system, the combat system, was created under the name TheTwistingHaunt using GitHub for version control.
            The revised project fit better with that class and was more in scope in terms of work versus time.
