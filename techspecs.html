            <h3>Frameworks</h3>
         </a>
         <p>
            The Twisting Haunt is written in its entirety using Java 8. The application handles its outside dependencies via Maven, and notable dependencies include
            Jackson, MongoDB, JUnit 4, and our custom library Entity Library. <br/> <br/>
            The UI is written using a Java native framework, Java Swing. Why Swing? Because we didn't know any better, and now it looks too cool to change.
            More realistically, we have considered migrating to JavaFX, or even converting the game into a REST or SOAP based web app, but determined that
            the amount of refactoring necessary and the additional features offered to us were not worth the amount of rework necessary for the UI. <br/><br/>
            Our Unit Tests are performed using JUnit, with assistance of Mockito where necessary - dominantly where database calls are necessary to populate Java objects.<br/><br/>
            Jackson binds our data pulled from our Mongo database and our save files to appropriate Java objects from their native file formats (BSON and JSON respectively).

            <h3>Custom Tools</h3>
         </a>
         <p>
            Custom Tools were developed to assist in the development of The Twisting Haunt and to remain DRY. These tools include the Entity Library,
            a package created that houses all custom objects for The Twisting Haunt, and Content Engine, which is a UI used for CRUD operations in the Twisting Haunt database
            to dramatically reduce bugs and improve time to enter new content into the game.
            <br/><br/>

            <h3>System Requirements</h3>
         </a>
         <div class="srs">
            <h3>0.0 Game Overview</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>The program will verify a connection to a database. If the connection fails, the game will not open.</li>
               <li>The above mentioned database will be stored on a remote server, rather than dependent on local files and server configuration.</li>
               <li>The program will execute as a windowed application.</li>
               <li>The program will open and check for any available save files. If a save file exists, the option to load from a save file will be available.</li>
               <li>If there is no save file available, the only selection available will be a new game.</li>
               <li>Upon starting a new game, a character will be required to be created. Dependent on decisions made during creation, it will affect the character's base stats.</li>
               <li>The program will allow text input of strings. If the string is illegal given the listed commands, it will return a help document.</li>
               <li>Upon successful command, result text will display and continue the interactions. Successful in this case is defined as a string that is contained within the listed commands.</li>
               <li>Battle sequences may contain a unique list of acceptable commands. The above two points are still accurate within battle sequences.</li>
               <li>Objects will be pulled from the database to be interacted with. This may include NPCs, items, and other objects as needed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>1.0 Winning The Game</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>You can't. You have lost the game.</li>
               <li>A player can win the game by successfully completing all quest objectives and reaching the end of the story. Verification of successful completion will occur in real time throughout the story as it is relevant for progression.</li>
               <li>The player will not be required to traverse the entirety of the map or interact with all objects.</li>
               <li>The required objects, travel, and interaction will be detailed within the player's active quest.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>2.0 Character Creation</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>The program will first verify whether or not a character has already been created.</li>
               <li>A player controlled character must be generated. This character may be generated with specifications determined by the program or by the user, as time permits.</li>
               <li>When the character is created, it should be determined to be a different entity than a NPC and thus treated differently by NPCs.</li>
               <li>The character will have a defined class, which will affect its base stats.</li>
               <li>The character should be capable of engaging in combat, collecting items, and navigating a map. These will be expanded upon further below.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>3.0 Navigation</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>A player will have a map that can be utilized at any time to determine location. The map will be generated using built in libraries.</li>
               <li>Character should be able to move North, South, East, and West. The map will reflect these changes as they are made. The direction moved will be verified with a database to verify character is within bounds.</li>
               <li>Followup: If character is out of bounds, a generic text displaying that they are at a part of the map that is unexplorable beyond this point.</li>
               <li>When the character moves to a new cell, data about the location will be pulled and the player will receive text about this new location.</li>
               <li>If a character reaches a cell with an encounter, the battle sequence will begin. The character will need to have a successful encounter to continue investigating the cell. (See below.)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>4.0 Encounters</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>Encounters will begin by reaching a cell that contains an aggressive NPC.</li>
               <li>Encounters will verify after each successful command whether HP has reached zero for the character or NPC. When one reaches zero, battle ends.</li>
               <li>Commands will be verified and be considered succesful if they are an acceptable string. If they are accepted further validation will occur.</li>
               <li>This validation includes ensuring that other parameters the action or object requires have been met. If they have not, the action will not complete and an appropriate message will display.</li>
               <li>If the command is not an acceptable string, a help document of available commands will display.</li>
               <li>A successful encounter is defined as the character having remaining HP while all aggressive NPCs have reached zero.</li>
               <li>After a successful encounter, other options within the cell become available.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>5.0 Interacting With Environment</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>Each new cell will contain a text description. These will generate based on location and quest objective.</li>
               <li>A character can interact with the environment using text based commands. These commands will be stored and can be accessed via a help document. The help document will also appear after an unsuccessful command.</li>
               <li>After successfully entering a command, appropriate text will appear to assist the player with completing a quest. The response may vary based on location and quest objective.</li>
               <li>The game will not display messages if objects within the cell are not interacted with. It is up to the player to be thorough in their examination of the cell.</li>
               <li>Commands within a cell will include talking, taking items, and examining surroundings. Based on the objects located within the cell, appropriate responses will be pulled.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>6.0 Interacting with NPCs</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>NPCs will be categorized as either aggressive or friendly. An aggressive NPC will trigger an encounter. A friendly NPC can be spoken to and can give/take items. This will be determined by a value.</li>
               <li>Friendly NPCs will typically be the source of quests or story progression. This will be validated against the database.</li>
               <li>Friendly NPCs will be created as time permits.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>7.0 Saving A Game</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>The player will have an option to save their game progress to return at a later time.</li>
               <li>The save file will be stored locally on the player's machine. It is not up to the client or database to retain save files.</li>
               <li>The option to save the game may be in real time or after completion of quest objectives.</li>
               <li>/SAVE will be one of the acceptable string commands.</li>
            </ol>

         </div>
         <a id="#architecture">
            <h3>System Architecture</h3>
         </a>
         <div class="sys-architecture">
            <p>The system architecture follows a Model-View-Controller development protocol. In this system, the Server acts as the Model, the Windowed Java Application as the View, and the Client executable as the Controller. This is done in order to maintain modularity between separate systems, so that each piece is not fully dependant on the usage of another. This design was instituted to allow for greater modification throughout the design process, to eliminate dependencies, and to structure development among teams.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Client</h3>
            <p>The package client will control the process flow between the server and the user interface. This will construct a windowed application, establish a database connection, input and output streams, and query execution.</p>
            <h3>Server</h3>
            <p>The client will establish a connection with a remote server run through AWS in order to execute queries based off of an external database. The client will then serialize objects (e.g. save states) into an external database, which will be referenced for reading and overwriting through queries to the database.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <h4>Database</h4>
               <blockquote>
                  <li>Developed and maintained within MySQL Constraints.</li>
                  <li>Largely queried in read contexts. The game information should not be overwritten in the event of  state changes (e.g. defeating an enemy combatant), so the already defined records will be loaded into the client for execution.</li>
                  <li>Organized according to overarching room tiles. From an object-oriented standpoint, each room can aggregreate combat encounters consisting of entities, who in turn will have items, abilities, formulaic statistics, etc. Furthermore, each room room will contain associated descriptive text to be output to the user.</li>
                  <li>The tables of the database will be normalized to Third Normal Form in order to maintain object relations.</li>
                  <li>The client will execute prepared queries on the database in order to populate the windowed application with display content.</li>
               </blockquote>
               <h4>Directory</h4>
               <blockquote>
                  <li>The client will have the ability to save and load serialized objects (e.g. Save States) into a multi-layered directory located on the server.</li>
                  <li>The Database will contain the references to these objects in order to form relational connections.</li>
                  <li>The directory would best be utilized to store predetermined static lists of objects that would be inefficient to repeatedly build through queries. An example of this would be a list of starting items that a user may always begin play with.</li>
                  <li>This could integrate with the client in order to assist in the retrieval of prepared statements that would be commonly queried throughout the game.</li>
               </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Windowed Application</h3>
            <p>The client will create a windowed Java Application in order to allow for greater accessiblity for the end user, eliminating the need for command line execution or running the files through an IDE. The windowed application will consist of three connected units: Graphical Output, Textual Output, and Textual Input.</p>
            <blockquote>
               <h4>Graphical Output</h4>
               <blockquote>
                  <li>The Graphical Output will consist of a live, cell-based map that will fill in as the user continues through his/her game.</li>
                  <li>This output will utilze the Lightweight Java Gaming Library API.</li>
               </blockquote>
               <h4>Textual Output</h4>
               <blockquote>
                  <li>The Textual Output will consist of menu display, room description, battle actions, dialogue, etc.</li>

                  <li>A pre-defined list of input commands will always be available to the user in the form of a "help" option.</li>
                  <li>Any of the commands in this list will allow the user to interact with the game. Examples of these may include "look," "talk," "attack," or "take."</li>
