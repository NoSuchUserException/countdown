        <p>
            The Twisting Haunt is written in its entirety using Java 8. The application handles its outside dependencies via Maven, and notable dependencies include
            Jackson, MongoDB, JUnit 4, and our custom library Entity Library. <br/> <br/>
            The UI is written using a Java native framework, Java Swing. Why Swing? Because we didn't know any better, and now it looks too cool to change.
            More realistically, we have considered migrating to JavaFX, or even converting the game into a REST or SOAP based web app, but determined that
            the amount of refactoring necessary and the additional features offered to us were not worth the amount of rework necessary for the UI. <br/><br/>
            Our Unit Tests are performed using JUnit, with assistance of Mockito where necessary - dominantly where database calls are necessary to populate Java objects.<br/><br/>
            Jackson binds our data pulled from our Mongo database and our save files to appropriate Java objects from their native file formats (BSON and JSON respectively).

        <p>
            Custom Tools were developed to assist in the development of The Twisting Haunt and to remain DRY. These tools include the Entity Library,
            a package created that houses all custom objects for The Twisting Haunt, and Content Engine, which is a UI used for CRUD operations in the Twisting Haunt database
            to dramatically reduce bugs and improve time to enter new content into the game.
