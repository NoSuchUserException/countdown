    	<p>The Twisting Haunt is the flagship application developed by Team Etarium. It is a text-based RPG, with its story inspired by cult classic RPG adventures, 
            including Skyrim, Dungeons & Dragons, and Final Fantasy. <br/><br/>
            The Twisting Haunt is a work in progress, not yet reaching alpha stage development. As our developers have matured, so has the core
            infrastructure and algorithms used to power The Twisting Haunt's engine. 
            <br/> <br/>This has led to regression on some functionality while we
            learn and more fully vet our decisions prior to integrating them into our codebase, and substantial refactoring when infrastructure has changed.
            <br/><br/>To be able to more fully understand the lifecycle of application development and to improve development, multiple additional tools were developed.
            These tools are also not yet version stable, however between these custom tools, managing our own cloud infrastructure, build and release pipelines, and work
            management tools, Team Etarium has learned many professional development skills through their 'hobby', The Twisting Haunt.
